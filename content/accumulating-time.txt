If you still remember, social media's mainstream moment came when people started posting to record life experiences. The phone camera used to be the most anticipated feature upgrade because you could capture fleeting moments.

Time never stops. The desire to accumulate time in the form of photographed experiences has created one of the largest industries today.

The desire is phenomenal not because of some marketing campaigns. It's one of the best things you can do for yourself.

People who effectively accumulate time gain a real advantage in life and set the stage to capture life-changing opportunities.

Think about long-lasting friendships and relationships, a good track record, a skill set or experience that you've been developing for 10 years that is still relevant today.

These things don't just accumulate. Like an investment, they usually compound. Think about friendship â€” you'd introduce your best friend to other very close friends. But a 'regular' friend doesn't get the same treatment.

At work, if what you did 10 years ago is still relevant today, you're competing with 10 years of experience against others who might just have one.

This strategy works best in an industry that plays the long game with long-term thinking people.

More importantly, start doing something that is meaningful to you today. What could be a more meaningful way to accumulate time?
