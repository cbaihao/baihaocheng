          History is made by those who failed well. Not by people who knew
          everything in advance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since I was young, I wondered why the world looks the way it does. Who
          shaped it?
        </p>

        <p>
          Most people secretly believe the world was built by someone smarter
          than them. Some authority, some government, some group of
          professionals who always knew what they were doing. It feels safer to
          think that. If something matters enough, surely &quot;they&quot; have
          it covered.
        </p>

        <p>
          But there is no &quot;they.&quot; That&apos;s the part people miss.
          The world isn&apos;t the product of a master plan executed by experts.
          It&apos;s what happened when a bunch of people tried things. And
          usually, they didn&apos;t fully know what they were doing.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you look closely at how anything significant got built, you find
          the same story. Someone thought, &quot;Maybe this will work,&quot; and
          tried it. Rockefeller didn&apos;t start out with a master plan to rule
          the oil industry. He had to deal with unexpected move by competitor to
          stay on top of the game.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Sumerians who made the first wheel didn&apos;t foresee cars or
          airplanes. Gaudí didn&apos;t finish the Sagrada Família. Progress
          doesn&apos;t look like a straight line planned by experts. It looks
          like experiments, many of which fail.
        </p>

        <p>
          It also means substantial resources could be invested before we know a
          sure answer.
        </p>

        <p>
          School teaches you there&apos;s always a right answer. Someone already
          solved the problem, and your job is to memorize it. That makes it easy
          to believe real life works the same way—that knowledge comes first,
          then action. But usually, it&apos;s the other way around.
        </p>

        <p>
          Action isn&apos;t something you do after you&apos;ve collected all the
          knowledge. Action is knowledge, crystallized. It contains more
          information than words ever can.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you&apos;ve ever coded, you know it&apos;s almost impossible to
          explain your code in plain words better than the code itself does. The
          code is the clearest version of your thinking.
        </p>

        <p>
          Failing well doesn&apos;t mean failing randomly. It means pushing into
          territory where no one has succeeded yet. That&apos;s how you learn
          things worth knowing.
        </p>

        <p>
          In Elon&apos;s early-days interview at Tesla, he said it would
          probably fail. But he also knew that even a failed attempt could push
          electric cars forward. He was willing to test reality instead of
          waiting for certainty. So far, he hasn&apos;t failed—and Tesla has
          changed the auto industry.
        </p>

        <p>Aim to fail well. It&apos;s easier to start that way as well.</p>
