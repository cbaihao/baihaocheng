          We all know the story: a company born from a simple idea, then growing
          into a trillion-dollar titan, making early participants wealthier than
          a lifetime of conventional work. The allure of that early Google, the
          possibility of a truly life-changing financial outcome, is undeniably
          powerful. We all want to be part of that company, or build one for
          ourselves.
        </p>

        <p>
          But hindsight is a map to yesterday&apos;s battles; it offers no
          advantage today. The events are set in stone; timing is everything.
          You cannot go back in time and claim those benefits.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even today, countless &quot;Day 1&quot; Googles, Facebooks, and
          Alibabas are emerging. The central question then becomes: how do you
          identify them now? What did Google actually look like in its first 100
          days? This is the essence of the opposite of hindsight.
        </p>

        <p>
          When seeking this &apos;opposite of hindsight,&apos; your perspective
          shifts dramatically. Unlike looking back, where you sift through an
          abundance of events, histories, and evidence, here, you&apos;re
          presented with no data. This moment is the newest point in history,
          the furthest edge of evolution. It&apos;s the frontier where history
          is actively being made. It&apos;s akin to standing on the edge of a
          vast unknown, looking out.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this context, &quot;find&quot; feels like a misleading word. There
          is nothing to find. Perhaps &quot;found&quot; is a more appropriate
          term, which explains the prevalence of &quot;founders&quot; in places
          like San Francisco.
        </p>

        <p>
          This brings us to a fundamental shift in perspective. The hindsight
          view implies a pre-ordained answer or blueprint that simply needs to
          be found—a logical fallacy when facing the unknown. To illustrate
          this, consider evolution: organisms evolve through biological traits.
          They experiment with their DNA, keeping the best, eventually becoming
          what they are. They don&apos;t start with a blueprint of their future
          form, nor do they &apos;find&apos; an ideal existence. Some even cease
          to exist in the process. There&apos;s no guaranteed path.
        </p>

        <p>
          Humanity, arguably past purely biological evolution, now experiments
          largely through its creations. We build, iterate, and the most
          effective become necessities in our daily lives—think railways,
          electricity, or electric cars. We&apos;ve clearly come a long way.
        </p>

        <p>
          The consistent theme, however, is experimentation, often accompanied
          by cost. When moving forward through history, the feeling isn&apos;t
          about finding an answer, but about giving your best try while striving
          to stay viable.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, what then is the opposite of hindsight? What might the next Google
          truly look like in its first 100 days? It isn&apos;t a guaranteed
          success or a neatly packaged opportunity. Instead, it likely presents
          as an experiment: a nascent endeavor that, if successful, promises
          tremendous impact, and, crucially, carries a reasonable chance of
          succeeding.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sam Altman captured this mindset: &apos;I want to choose a project
          where, if successful, makes the rest of my career look like a
          footnote.&apos; This isn&apos;t about pinpointing a specific company
          from a list of potentials. It&apos;s about a first-principles approach
          to the most fundamental questions: What holds true value? What truly
          matters to society, to human interaction? What are the most impactful
          breakthroughs on the horizon? What are the profound implications of
          nascent changes? Why are things structured the way they are today?
        </p>

        <p>
          When an experiment of this magnitude succeeds, society assigns it
          immense value, and that&apos;s when people get rich. We often
          underestimate long-term potential. It&apos;s far easier to grasp a
          project&apos;s vast potential—that it could make the rest of your
          career a footnote—than to precisely calculate its future dollar worth.
          The strategy, then, is to pursue projects with high potential, ensure
          you don&apos;t get ruined in the pursuit, and trust that if you
          contribute your best work and the sector takes off, history will
          reward you handsomely.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our inability to accurately value new things often leads to market
          bubbles. This is an almost inevitable part of cutting-edge endeavors,
          and it can be both an advantage and a disadvantage for a founder.
        </p>

        <p>
          A less obvious, yet crucial, point: these impactful experiments often
          carry less true risk than commonly perceived. When a technological
          breakthrough is identified as truly century-defining, society invests
          enormous resources into making it a reality. In such cases, it&apos;s
          almost certain someone in the industry will figure it out.
          Consequently, everyone benefits—from the resulting products, the
          underlying technology, or new research. While pinpointing the ultimate
          winner might prove challenging, the entire sector generally thrives.
          The clear winner often captures the most, but along the way, ample
          opportunities for wealth emerge for those who build the right skill
          sets aligned with the unfolding problem, regardless of the specific
          venture they&apos;re on.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Berkeley, I was lucky enough to know the founders of many
          breakthrough startups when they were early: Databricks, Brex, Zoom,
          Imbue to name a few. At the time, I found them impressive, yet still
          perceived them as too early and &quot;risky.&quot; All went on to
          become $1bn+ companies far faster than I&apos;d anticipated. We all
          carry biases, but perhaps it&apos;s a superior bias to lean towards
          early rather than late. To believe it will happen sooner than you
          think; you&apos;ll likely be right more often than not.
        </p>

        <p>
          For an individual, cultivating a unique skill set for the most
          important problems is a high-leverage move, if not arguably the
          highest.
